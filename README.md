# README

Hello everyone!

This is my Rails/React Assesment for Kasaz. 

As any normal project over there, here we should use these commands:

bundle install 

and 

yarn

So we can install every dependency required by Rails/React.

Then, clearly,

rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

The last one in case you want to populate the database.
