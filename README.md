Hello everyone!

This is my Rails/React Assesment for Kasaz. 

As any normal project over there, here we should use these commands:

bundle install 

and 

yarn

So we can install every dependency required by Rails/React.

Then, clearly,

rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

The last one in case you want to populate the database.

I wanted to do a bit more about the original requirements, and I made a simple, really simple login method, so people can register and login to have special functions.

You can rate a property and there is a sample form to reservate a visit. Thinking about as an app for house hunters to find a visit the house they want to have, using the filters required.
